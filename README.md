# Nikita Yuragin's laboratory work on the discipline "TRSIS"

### Already implemented: 
 - **lab1example**          - a simple servlet and filter implementation
 - **lab2example**          - a simple REST and OpenAPI http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
 - **lab3example**          - a simple application based on REST (spring-boot) and AJAX (bootstrap +angular)
 - **lab4example**          - a simple application with authorization (spring-boot, thymeleaf, angular)
 - **lab6jdbcexample**      - a simple application using JDBC access to database. The code demonstrates how much efforts you need to make JDBC data access thread-safe and efficient.
 - **transactionsdemo**     - a simple application demonstrating usage of transactions. All deletes in main data cause first writing change history. If deletion does not succeed (e.g. due to foreign key restrictions) change history rolls back.
