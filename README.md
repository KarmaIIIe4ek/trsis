# Code samples for my course named "Technologies of Server System Development"

## list of samples:

### Already implemented:
 - **springhelloworld**     - a trivial spring-boot based console app 
 - **lab1example**          - a simple servlet and filter implementation
 - **lab2example**          - a simple REST and OpenAPI http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
 - **lab3example**          - a simple application based on REST (spring-boot) and AJAX (bootstrap +angular)
 - **lab4example**          - a simple application with authorization (spring-boot, thymeleaf, angular)
 - **lab6jdbcexample**      - a simple application using JDBC access to database. The code demonstrates how much efforts you need to make JDBC data access thread-safe and efficient.
 - **transactionsdemo**     - a simple application demonstrating usage of transactions. All deletes in main data cause first writing change history. If deletion does not succeed (e.g. due to foreign key restrictions) change history rolls back.
 - **lab78example**         - an elementary example how to create microservice app with the basic tools learned in my course
 

### Planned:
 - **lab5thymeleafexample** - a simple application based on thymeleaf
 - **lab6jdbctmpexample**   - a simple application using JDBC template access to database.
 - **lab6jdbcspdatexample** - a simple application using Spring-Data-JDBC access to database. 
 - **lab6jpaexample**       - a simple application using Spring-Data-JPA access to database.
